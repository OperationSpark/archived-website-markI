          <p>Access for all!</p>

          <p>One third of New Orleans is living in poverty and schools are failing our communities struggling with generational poverty as relevant workforce development in the area of software is not reaching our youth while jobs in this sector remain unfilled.</p>

          <p>2010 studies show that in New Orleans there were 16,000 young adults between the ages of 16 and 25 disconnected from school and not employed. This fact amounts to 220 million dollars in annual losses for the city, and 4.1 billion generationally.  Current studies are showing the number of disconnected youth between 25,000 and 30,000.</p>

          <p>Meanwhile as of the summer of 2014, there are 3000 open positions in the field of software development in the state of Louisiana, and more jobs are materializing as technology is on the rise in the greater area of New Orleans.</p>

          <p>If we continue to import specialists for this well paying employment, we will miss a great opportunity to provide a doorway to prosperity for the deserving communities of New Orleans.  We must strive to assist our youth into meaningful employment, and opportunity is now.</p>

          <p>Through our intensive boot camps, teacher training, and app-year workforce development program, our participants have serious opportunities to develop their software skills and themselves.  Our strategy will allow us to reach upwards of 25,000 young adults in the next five years, and while we don't profess that each of these youth will become software engineers, we can assure that each will be literate in rudimentary software skills, and thereby be ready to make informed and prepared choices toward a career in software development.</p>

          <p>By learning to develop software using real tools, adopting best practices, building actual products, with the same workflow used by professional developers, kids have a leg up on other methods that use non production tools, toys or boutiquette web apps that do not represent the day to day of professional development.</p>

          <p>We adhere to a set of standards that encourage an open and inclusive culture, as outlined in our Culture of Code manifesto, whereby all members of Operation Spark serve to uphold and maintain super effective learning opportunites and an awesome working environment where all races are equal, all genders welcome, and where youth of lower-income communities are given full access the learning  and young women are encouraged into positions of leadership.</p>

          <p>These cultural standards are not rules rigidly forced upon our crew, but objectives by which strive to live up to, and certainly there will be moments wherein we miss our target, but collectively we work to steer individuals and our groups back on the path to tolerance, inclusiveness and awesomeness.</p>

          <p>Our mandate at Operation Spark is ACCESS FOR ALL!  The field of software development is wide and should be a doorway to prosperity for all communities!  The time for action is now!</p>
