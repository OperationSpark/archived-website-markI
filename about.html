        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>8 in 10 programmers in the software industry are white, so while we can focus on the socioeconomic reasons for this imbalance, we see opportunity: There’s room in the industry for people of color.</p>

        <p>Focusing on New Orleans, where generational poverty is an issue, we are concerned with developing and distributing effective learning tools to help circumvent the costs of higher education, and toward workforce development, help young adults find the quickest route to production.</p>

        <p>What does that mean concretely? Learn to write software using industrial tools, write actual apps, work in an awesome team environment, and become self sufficient by taking an autodidactic approach to higher education and problem solving.</p>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>Operation SPARK started as a pilot project, developed and conducted at youth community centers around New Orleans, teaching young adults how to build simple mobile video games and apps with the aim of igniting the pursuit of an employable passion.</p>

        <p>Student participants learned to design, build and deploy simple mobile apps and games. Teachers and mentors inspired students in grasping skills necessary to complete project tasks.</p>

        <p>The skills involved in building mobile video games and apps are quite varied, including application design, game mechanics and user experience, visual and sound design, computer engineering of various sorts, project, product and cost management, content management and public relations of all kinds as well as effective means of communication and conflict resolution. And so the idea is simple: By introducing young adults to this wide set of skills and helping them apply these skills in building a simple project, something as engaging to today’s youth as a mobile video game or app, participants may just discover a very employable field about which they are passionate. And for youth, developing a passion is key to positive self development and encourages self learning and the pursuit of a path into college or the work force!</p>
